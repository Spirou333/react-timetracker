# react-timetracker
A simple impersistent react application that can be used to track time over the day.
The application is still rather small and will be expanded with more features step by step.

## Planned Features
* Start and stop a timer for entries
* Switch between "Timer" and "Add Entry"
* Adding a graphical timepicker
* Duplicate entry recognition
* Editing existing entries
* Export entries as JSON
* Entering dates to the timeentries
* Adding a datepicker

## Planned Improvements
* Using moment.js for advanced date and time handling
